<div class="pure-u-1">
  <p>
1. The game and each point begin with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. The defense throws ("pulls") the disc to the offense. 
2. The disc is only to be moved up the field by passing between teammates. No walking with the disc.  Once the disc is caught, the only steps that can be taken are to stop any momentum that was present prior to the catch, or a pivot off of one foot.
3. Each team must have a minimum of 5 players to play (5v5 or more). If a team does not have at least 5 players present, it will count as a 
forfeit.
4. This is a non-contact sport, so any form of intentional contact is a foul. 
5. This is also a self-officiated sport.  The players directly involved with the play are responsible to make the call.  The two captains will determine the punishment of the foul.  If a call cannot be agreed on, the observing captain will serve as the “tie-breaker”.
6. Outside of the two captains whose respective teams are playing, there must be at least one additional captain observing the game to verify score, calls, and sportsmanship. 
7. Any time a pass is not completed (i.e. interception, drop, out of bounds, block, stall count reached) is a turnover.
8. Stall counts will be used.  This is when the defensive player who is directly covering the offensive player currently in possession of the disc counts to 10, and if the disc is not passed by “10”, it is a turnover.
9. No cleats or spikes of any kind.  Playing barefoot is acceptable, but do this at your own risk.
10. Boundaries will be agreed upon by captains prior to the game.
11. Substitutions may only be made in between points or in the event of an injury.
12.  Overall, just play nice. This is an annual event that many people join just to have fun and play frisbee, so don’t be a jerk and ruin it for 
everyone.
